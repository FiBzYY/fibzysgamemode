# 🚀 Installation Guide

📥 Download the **Bhop** gamemode and place it into your **`gamemodes/`** folder.  
🗄️ Set up a **MySQL server**. This requires sqloo addon!
📂 Move `sv.db` into the **`garrysmod/`** directory.  
📌 Use the `timer.sql` file to import the required database tables.  
🔧 Open `server.cfg` and set up your **SQL connection details** to match your MySQL server.  
⚙️ Ensure your **server settings** are properly configured in `server.cfg`.  
🎨 Modify the **config files** to adjust game settings as needed.
