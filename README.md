Thank You for Choosing Bunny Hop by FiBzY!  
This gamemode is primarily authored and maintained by me (FiBzY) with help from the community. While I take great pride in developing and optimizing the core systems, Bunny Hop wouldn’t be what it is today without these contributors' awesome input!

**Note:** AI (OpenAI) was used only for fixing syntax bugs, reviewing code, and brainstorming ideas—not full code generation.

If you fork this, please keep the About section intact to respect all contributors and myself.

Ignore: Niflheimrx's fork. There is no AI-written code everywhere – the project is 99% handcrafted with love, only assisted occasionally by AI for polishing.

All core systems were developed and refined by FiBzY using input from community contributors.
