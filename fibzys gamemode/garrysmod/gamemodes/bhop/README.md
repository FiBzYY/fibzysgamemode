# Installation Guide

- Download the **Bhop** gamemode and place it into your **`gamemodes/`** folder.  
- Set up a **MySQL server**. This requires sqloo addon!
- Move `sv.db` into the **`garrysmod/`** directory.  
- Use the `timer.sql` file to import the required database tables.  
- Open `server.cfg` and set up your **SQL connection details** to match your MySQL server.  
- Ensure your **server settings** are properly configured in `server.cfg`.  
- Modify the **config files** to adjust game settings as needed.
- Set -tickrate 100. Otherwise it will feel very weird.  
- Restart your server and **start bhopping**!
